# CAP5771-Final-Project
 Final Project for CAP5771 Data and Text Mining

***Abstract*--One of the many steps in modeling transportation systems, is understanding the street network and the characteristics of the roads and intersections thereof. In this paper, we utilize R to perform principle component analysis and association rule learning to explore and classify the characteristics of a street network spatially.**

Welcome to my final for CAP5771 Data and Text Mining.

#### data
Node (vertex) and Edge data are stored as `.csv` here. This is preprocessed data.

#### orlando-seg1
The raw SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) street network (SN) data for Orlando, Florida.

#### R
The meat of the project is in this directory. It contains the `.rmd` and `.html` of the project report as well a bibiliography.

#### sumo2csv
This is the Python script used for preprocessing the raw SN data.
